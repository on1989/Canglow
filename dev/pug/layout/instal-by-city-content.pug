						h1 Windows And Doors Installation & Replacement Services
							span Yellowknife
						p With 19,234 residents, Yellowknife toes the line between quaint little town and big city. It is the capital city and largest community in the Northwest Territories and lies on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake. The city boasts 11 official languages and is rife with historic charm. Yellowknife may find itself in the middle of a vast subarctic wilderness but it offers residents and visitors modern amenities and more gorgeous scenery than the eye can see. The city rests on the Canadian Shield, where some rock formations date back billions of years. We can’t guarantee that our windows and doors will last that long but when you switch to Canglow, you’ll have our products in your home for a very, very, very, long time.

						h3 Durable Doors and Windows
						p Canglow Windows & Doors build our products to last. We are a Canadian company that understands the facets of the very harsh Canadian winter. Because we live through the cold, year in and year out, we craft our products to stand up to the elements. Our windows and doors are made with lead-free uPVC and help fight against energy loss. In the cold months, our windows lock in heat. In the warm months, our windows keep heat out. When you outfit your Yellowknife home with Canglow products you can even save money on your heating and cooling bills. According to some of our customers, they were able to reduce their monthly bill by up to 25%. Every dollar adds up and we’re happy to help you conserve energy and your bank account.
